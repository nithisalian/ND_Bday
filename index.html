        your spontaneity and dedication to college debauchery has not only improved, but shaped my college experience. your kindness and maturity oftentimes make you the voice of reason in the group which can be incredibly refreshing considering our friends, and those traits always pose a fun challenge when i decide to antagonize the situation. i’m actually just now realizing that im older than you so id be remiss if i didn’t call you lil bro. anyway, keep killing it my treacherous twin ⛓️🩸 </div></div>
    <div class="card"><button onclick="toggleMessage(this)">💌</button><div class="message">From Aryan: To the man, the myth, the menace in the paint: Happy Birthday, Navin! You’ve survived half of college, yellow sludge roommate trauma, and been an absolute handball beast; honestly, Hall of Fame resume stuff. You’ve got impeccable film taste, killer handball instincts, and the court presence of Dennis Rodman, and I can’t wait to see what the house ends up like this year. May the Bulls surprise you, may the Bears not ruin your Sundays, and may your roommates handle their own bodily fluids. Big love, bro (but, also, next time you get a layup over me, I’m tripping you). </div></div>

You and I have such similar humors, which makes all the hang outs way more fun (throwback to crying over ant jokes at Layla’s bday dinner). I hope we get to hang out more at bombacrib next year! Have a great one!</div></div>
    <div class="card"><button onclick="toggleMessage(this)">💌</button><div class="message">Hi Navin, happy birthday! Maybe the milestone of turning 20 itself isn’t a big deal, but know that we’ve seen you grow and learn to be an even more mature and thoughtful person than you already were. There has been many a moment where I’ve looked to your wisdom in specific. It’s been so nice to have known you for the last two years. I’m glad that I have someone in my life that I share an interest in film with and someone who has the best kind of subtle humor (and the loud humor when it’s necessary). So many memorable nights spent with you and the gang… I’m very grateful to be your friend and I hope you know that I don’t take you for granted even a bit. Love you and see you soon!! - Raghav </div></div>

Lowkey I’ll start at the beginning I remember our first Cobb floor meeting with Reef I was like DAMN what a beard 🤝 I can’t believe the two year ride that has followed and im so eternally grateful for all the memories. So many hijinks and hoodwinks and general tomfoolery- we building generational dad lore. Thankful for your amazingly genuine presence in my life - I feel like we have so much in common n wish I could have known u for my whole life n maybe that u weren’t a Bears fan but I can overlook some things 💔 Your drive, thoughtfulness, and creativity inspires me and I’m excited to see all the amazing things you get up to in the years to come. Johnson soaked asf writing this. Nobody I’d rather go ginger ale for ginger ale with 😭😭💔💔</div></div>

You’re one of the most grounded and genuinely solid people I know, and it’s been real having you as a roommate and a friend. You’ve got a rare mix of good judgment, a strong sense of who you are, and you’re honestly one of the funniest people I know—naturally, without even trying. Wishing you nothing but the best this year: more opportunities, more growth, and moments that remind you just how far you’ve come. Glad to be in your corner as you keep pushing forward. Enjoy the day, man. You deserve it.</div></div>

      Happy Birthday Navin! You're finally 20 (no more cougar jokes!!). Even though we've only been dating for 7 months, I feel like we've been in each other's lives since childhood.  I'm so lucky to call you my boyfriend. Dating you has shown me how kind, passionate, caring, and funny (you can be the funnier one today i guess) of a man you are. I never anticipated that transferring to UNC would lead me to find my best friend and boyfriend all in one person. I cherish all of the memories we have created together and am so grateful to have the opportunity to create more with you. Here's to another year of watching movies and TV together, trying new restaurant (and sweet treats), talking about books we're reading, sending each other 50 reels a day, and more. I love you so much and I hope you have the best day ever. Get a little sweet treat for me ;)
      </p>
